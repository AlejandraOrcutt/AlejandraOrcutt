- ⚡ Fun fact #1: When I was 3 or 4, I was eating a piece of meat in a garden. Suddenly a chicken started to chase my to steal the piece of meat. I run terrified of the chicken trying to save the piece of meat I had in my little hand. I do not remember who ended up keeping the meat.
- ⚡ Fun fact #2: After that, I became a vegetarian.
