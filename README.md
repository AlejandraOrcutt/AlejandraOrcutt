- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create loops and simple appliations using Java
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require knowledge of cloud computing or need data pipelines using SQL and Python 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with finding a niche and a community, since I am fairly new
- 💬 Ask me about trouble shooting. I believe emotional self regulation and "Googling" skills are arts to be mastered

- ⚡ Fun fact #1: When I was 3 or 4, I was eating a piece of meat in someone's backyard. Suddenly, a chicken came out of nowhere and started to chase me to steal the piece of meat I was holding. I run terrified trying to outrun the chicken. I do not remember who ended up keeping the meat.
- ⚡ Fun fact #2: After that, I became a vegetarian.
